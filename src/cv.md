I am a full-stack JavaScript Developer from Copenhagen. I recently graduated as a BA in Web Development. I am passionate with React (and React Native), GraphQL, GatsbyJS, Node.js, accessibility, performance, and user experience. I believe in finding the right tools for the job, and I am not afraid to dive into uncharted waters. I love to learn, and am constantly trying out new tech.

I am 26 years old, and live in the North Western neighborhood of Copenhagen with my girlfriend. I enjoy brewing coffee â€” _the nerdy way_; playing and listening to music, and working on all sorts of programming side projects to hone my skills as a developer.

## Proficiencies

My main proficiencies include:

- Modern JavaScript development, including ES6 and beyond.
- Modern front end frameworks, primarily React, but also GatsbyJS, Next.js, and Angular.
- Full-stack development with Node.js, mostly with Express.js.
- GraphQL.
- SQL and NoSQL databases, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.
- HTML and CSS, obviously.

And some of the stuff I know, but want to learn even better:

- Testing, primarily using Jest, react-testing-library, and Cypress.io.
- Javascript bundlers, e.g., Webpack and Parcel.
- Docker, and associate tools such as Dokku.
- Typescript.
- React Native.
- Serverless, e.g., AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Platform.
